#Snake.ai
Classic Snake game remastered with Artificial Intelligence.

#About
A Snake game built on Python is turned into a Machine Learning model, which trains itself via Deep Q Learning and Back Propagation. The reward of positive 10 is set each time when the snake engulfs food particle, while a negative reward of 10 is set when the snake hits the boundary. The AI learns from numerous attempts, taking atleast five minutes before it can stabilize after moving randomly (tradeoff between exploration and exploitation)
